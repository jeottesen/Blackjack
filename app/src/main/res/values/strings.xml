        <b>Objective:</b>\n
        Score a higher hand than Dealer – but no more than 21!\n\n
        <b>Card Values:</b>  (Suit does not matter)\n
        \t\t\t\t<b>Ace:</b>\t\t1 or 11\n
        \t\t\t\t<b>2 - 10:</b>\t\tface value\n
        \t\t\t\t<b>Face card:</b>\t\t10  \n\n



<b>Bust:</b>\n  Scoring higher than 21.\n\n
<b>Blackjack:</b>\n  Getting dealt two cards that equal exactly 21.\n\n
<b>Hit:</b>\n  Draw another card.\n\n
<b>Stand:</b>\n  Stop drawing and wait for Dealer’s hand to be complete.\n\n
<b>Push:</b>\n  Player’s score is the same as Dealer’s – without busting!\n\n\n

<b>Gameplay:</b>\n\n
Two cards are dealt to Dealer, and two to Player.\n\n
        One of Dealer’s cards is face-down.\n\nIf Dealer’s face-up card is either an Ace or a ten-card, Dealer peeks at the face-down card to see if the two cards make Blackjack (score of 21).
\n\nIf Dealer has Blackjack, gameplay stops.
        \n\nIf Player also has Blackjack, it’s a tie – a Push.  Otherwise Player loses.
\n\nIf Dealer does not have Blackjack, Player may Hit multiple times, or Stand.  If the score goes over 21, Player loses (Bust).
\n\nIf Player chooses to Stand, Dealer reveals the face-down card, and then Hits until Dealer’s score is greater than 17.
\n\nIf Dealer’s score goes over 21, Dealer busts and Player wins (unless Player also busted).
\n\nIf Dealer’s score is under or equal to 21 and higher than Player’s, Dealer wins.
\n\nIf Dealer’s score is under or equal to 21 and lower than Player’s, Player wins.
\n\nIf Dealer’s and Player’s score are both 21 or under, and are equal, it’s a Push (Tie).
\n\nIf Player is dealt Blackjack initially, and Dealer does not have Blackjack, Player automatically wins.
